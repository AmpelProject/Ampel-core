		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		The following task is bit complex, hence the lengthy explanation.
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		TLDR: This function computes and returns a dict structure t2s_eff required 
		for creating T2 docs. This computation is necessary since:
			* T0 filters can return a customized the list of T2 runnables to be run 
			* The photopoint compoundId of a given alert can be different between channels (since those 
			  can have different config parameters [include autoComplete points, custom exclusions, etc])
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		The input parameter of alert ingesters is a list ('array_of_scheduled_t2_units') 
		of combinations of scheduled T2 unit Ids ({set of T2 unit names} returned by T0 filters). 
		The size of array_of_scheduled_t2_units corresponds to the number of "active" channel 
		('active' meaning that the T0 AlertProcessor has loaded the channel)
		
		A concrete example of array_of_scheduled_t2_units could be:
		  [{"PHOTO_Z", "AGN"}, {"PHOTO_Z", "SNCOSMO"}, etc...]
		
		where each position in the array corresponds to a specific channel name
		  ["CHANNEL_GRB", "CHANNEL_SN", etc...]

		let's bring the two info above in a more compact form for the sake of this documentation:
		Say array_of_scheduled_t2_units provides the following information:
		
		  CHANNEL_SN: {"SNCOSMO", "PHOTO_Z"}
		  CHANNEL_GRB: {"GRB_FIT", "PHOTO_Z", "SNCOSMO"} 
		
		One important fact to keep in mind is that T0 filters can 'customize' scheduled T2s, 
		which means we could have alternatively:
		
		  CHANNEL_SN: {"SNCOSMO"} 
		  CHANNEL_GRB: {"GRB_FIT", "PHOTO_Z"} 
		
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		in __init__ this class has set - based on info from the ampel db config - 
		the value of self.dd_full_t2Ids_runConfigs_chanlist which could look like this:
		
		  - SNCOSMO 
		    - default
		        {"CHANNEL_SN", "CHANNEL_LENS"}
		    - mySetting
		        CHANNEL_GRB
		  - PHOTO_Z 
		    - default
		        {"CHANNEL_SN", "CHANNEL_LENS", "CHANNEL_GRB"}
		  - GRB_FIT:
		    - default
		        {"CHANNEL_GRB"}
		
		Note: self.dd_full_t2Ids_runConfigs_chanlist is built only using 'active' channels.
		
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		INNER LOOP 1 matches the function parameter 'array_of_scheduled_t2_units' with 
		'dd_full_t2Ids_runConfigs_chanlist' in order to create 't2s_eff' (eff=effective) 
		which - based on the example with 'customized' scheduled T2s - would look like this:
		
		  - SNCOSMO 
		    - default
		        {"CHANNEL_SN"}
		  - PHOTO_Z 
		    - default
		        {"CHANNEL_SN", "CHANNEL_GRB"}
		  - GRB_FIT:
		    - default
		        {"CHANNEL_GRB"}

		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		INNER LOOP 2 adds a third level to the dict t2s_eff in order to take into account 
		that an alert loaded by different channels might result in different compounds!

		Let's consider the previous example but limited to PHOTO_Z with param "default" only.
		INNER LOOP 2 makes sure that CHANNEL_SN & CHANNEL_GRB are associated with the same compound 
		(by checking compoundId equality), otherwise different t2 *docs* should be created:
			
	    If compound ids differ between 	                  If compound ids are equals,
		CHANNEL_SN & CHANNEL_GRB, *two*                   *one* t2 doc will be created
		t2 docs will be created                 

		 - PHOTO_Z                                        - PHOTO_Z
		 	- default                                        - default
			  - compoundid: a1b2c3d4                           - compoundid: a1b2c3d4
					{"CHANNEL_SN"}           VS                    {"CHANNEL_SN", "CHANNEL_GRB"}

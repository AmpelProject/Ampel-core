Ampel: Alert Management, Photometry and Evaluation of Light curves
==================================================================

Astronomers have during the recent decades continuously refined tools for
analyzing individual astronomical transients. Much of this work is currently
developed in python. Simultaneously, progress in instrument and CCD
manufacturing as well as data processing has led to a series of transient
surveys that can repeatedly scan large volumes of the Universe and find
thousands of real transients. This creates new opportunities both for finding
rare objects and for collecting statistically complete samples of the variable
Universe.

Ampel is a software framework meant to assist in the transition from studies of
individual objects (selected with a non-negligible random component) to
systematically selected samples. Ampel is a framework in that existing analysis
code designed for transients can be inserted and applied to selected candidates.

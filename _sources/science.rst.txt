Sample science cases
--------------------

Supernova explosion physics
===========================

Initiate immediate action if a candidate transient can be shown to be very young or in a very nearby galaxy. Additionally, send an alert if an active supernova is behaving "weirdly".


A type Ia supernova sample for use in cosmology
===============================================

Create a large sample of well calibrated type Ia SNe in a target redshift range. To avoid selection biases and allow environmental studies the potential contamination of non-SN Ia should be none or minimal, and the probability for inclusion should not depend on type of or position in host galaxy. 


Multi-messenger
===============

Prioritize candidates based on their likelihood to be connected to an external trigger based on multi-messenger information. Sensitivity to active transients, but typically focus on transients with an explosion date consistent with the external trigger. De-prioritize candidates likely to be e.g. type Ia supernovae or AGN related.

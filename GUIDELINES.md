Naming conventions
------------------

- Class names: CamelCase
- Method names: snake_case
- Dict keys: camelCase


File structure
--------------

- One class per file (PEP 20: _Explicit is better than implicit_)


Other
-----

- Prefer tab over space
- Use docstrings for each class & method, preferably using reST style:
```
"""
:param param1: this is a first param
:param param2: this is a second param
:returns: this is a description of what is returned
:raises keyError: raises an exception
"""
```

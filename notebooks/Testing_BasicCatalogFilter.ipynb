    "# Tesing BasicCatalogFilter \n",
    "\n",
    "The BasicCatalogFilter makes it possible to accept or reject alerts if there is a spatial coincidence with some sources of a given astronomical catalog. In this notebook, we illustrate how to use the BasicCatalogFilter to reject alerts nearby AGNs catalogued in the Million Quasar Catalog ([MQC](http://quasars.org/milliquas.htm))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we define a channel named HU_NOAGN by providing the channel configuration parameters. The way our example channel HU_NOAGN interacts with the BasicCatalogFilter is defined in a specific section of the channel config. In particular, you have to provide: \n",
    "\n",
    "* name of the catalog to be used for cross matching.\n",
    "* name of the columns of the catalog containing Ra and Dec (e.g. 'RAJ2000', 'ra', ecc.)\n",
    "* search radius (in arcsec)\n",
    "* how the position of the alert has to be estimated, e.g. the all-epoch average or the current position of the alert. \n",
    "* search method for the catalog queries. This depends on the chosen indexing strategy for the catalog database.\n",
    "* what to do when a match has been found within the search radius, i.e. either reject or accept the alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the configuration of the BasicCatalogFilter we will demonstrate here:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"t0Filter\": {\n",
    "    \"id\": \"BasicCatalogFilter\",\n",
    "    \"runConfig\": {\n",
    "        \"catName\": \"milliquas\",\n",
    "        \"catRAKey\": \"ra\",\n",
    "        \"catDecKey\": \"dec\",\n",
    "        \"searchMethod\": \"healpix\",\n",
    "        \"rsArcsec\": 3,\n",
    "        \"rejectOnMatch\": true,\n",
    "        \"alertPosType\": \"av\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rejectOnMatch` flag makes it possible to use catalog matching both to veto or to accept transients. That is, if you have a catalog of objects wich you are not (scientifically) interested in, you'd want to set the rejectOnMatch to True. In this case, a transitent will be accepted if no counterpart in the Boring Object Catalog is found. On the other hand, set rejectOnMatch to False if the catalog you're matching contains positoins of special interest to you. In this case, the alerts will be accepted if they match with the Really Cool Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the above settings: we will reject alerts if there is **at least one MQC** source within **3** arcsec from the all-epoch **average** position of the alert. The catalog ra/dec columns names are rather plain, and the queries routines will make use of the HEALPix index of the catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "The external catalogs to be examined have to be parsed into a database. The pacakage [extcats](https://github.com/MatteoGiomi/extcats) provides tools for setting up such a database and for querying it for positional matches. To run this example, git-clone the extcat package and run the setup script (the MQC is included in the test data)."

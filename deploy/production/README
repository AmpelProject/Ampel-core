Services are split across burst and transit. Since the singularity-stack
processes on each are unaware of each other, configuration is shared
through the environment variables defined in the .env file. To deploy,
run on each machine, eg on burst:

/scratch/jvs/Ampel/deploy/up burst

Then you can view the logs with e.g.:

singularity-stack logs burst alertprocessor -f

and stop the stack again with:

singularity-stack rm burst

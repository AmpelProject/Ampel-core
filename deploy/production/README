Services are split across burst and transit. Since the singularity-stack
processes on each are unaware of each other, configuration is shared
through the environment variables defined in the .env file. To deploy,
run on each machine:

env $(cat /scratch/jvs/Ampel/deploy/production/.env | xargs echo) singularity-stack deploy -c /scratch/jvs/Ampel/deploy/production/burst.yml ampel

Then you can view the logs with e.g.:

singularity-stack logs ampel -s mongo

and stop the stack again with:

singularity-stack rm ampel
